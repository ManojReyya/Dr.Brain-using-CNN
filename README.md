Upload MRI Images: Upload your brain MRI image to detect the presence of a tumor.
Tumor Detection: Classifies if a tumor is present (Yes or No).
Tumor Type Classification: If a tumor is detected, it predicts its type (Glioma, Meningioma, No Tumor, Pituitary).
User-Friendly Interface: Science-themed design for an engaging experience.
